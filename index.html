<h1>Welcome to The Copper Sanctum</h1>
<p>The Copper Sanctum is my little sanctuary on the internet. I make things for D&D. <a href="http://bit.ly/SolsticeShenanigans">Solstice Shenanigans</a> was my breakout release and it joined the ranks of the Silver Best Sellers within a week of release. Since then, it's gone gold this season. My next release was <a href="http://bit.ly/OS-LoveBites">Love Bites</a>, a Valentine's Day inspired adventure set in the land of Chult. Recently I released a <a href="http://bit.ly/TCSx2Sheet">Textless 3x5 Character Sheet</a> designed for portability and accessibility, complete with a colorblind sensitive color-coded version refined with the help of many helpful members of the Twitter D&D community. Then came a <a href="http://bit.ly/TCSx2FullSheet">full size version of TCSx2</a>, for those who prefer pictures but still want something more traditional. After that I released a trio of Bard College options, <a href="http://bit.ly/BitesBurnsBlackMagic">Bites, Burns & Black Magic</a>, and  participated in <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/247390">DM Jam 2</a> on the DM's Guild, winning second place. Coming out in the Spring is <i>The Carnival Compendium</i>. You can find more information about that in the updates.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of creating several procedural NPC and setting generators in addition to a few other projects. I've used many generators in the past, and I always felt like there was something lacking. I mean no offense to any of the creators of them, but I'm striving to create more than just a generator. I want to make something that will inspire great stories at your table. My goal is to create the best generators possible.</p>
<p>Not Another Tavern Generator is in Beta! It generates everything I planned on it doing now. Next up for it is cleanup, polish, and refinement of formulas. If you find any bugs or have any questions or comments, you can find me on Facebook and Twitter by hitting the logos. If you like what I'm doing and want to see more from me sooner, buy me a coffee. And go check out what else is on the DM's Guild and support small creators!</p><br>
